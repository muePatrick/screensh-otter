## Screensh-Otter

![Image of an otter taking a photo of a screen](screensh-otter-header.png)

**The Plan**:
1. get triggered by other service
2. take screenshot of specific element on given webpage
3. send image to configured Apprise URL

This basically what I need to complete my Changedetection.io workflow where I
want to create an image everytime the target changes. But what I need is not
only the image of the full page but of a specific part, after I removed some
elements and did some cleaning up. This way I can directly use the result as
something I can post somewhere. Think patchnotes send to a Discord channel.
